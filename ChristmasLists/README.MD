# Overview

My mother came to me asking if I could digitize our family's christmas lists going back several years. But I didn't want to just dump all the data into a spreadsheet and call it good. So using MVC in the .NET framework, I built this app.

This web app provides a landing page, and a lists page that allows the user to input entries of christmas gifts and then see them and filter them.

This was to help me learn C# and provide a product for my mother.

# Development Environment

All the development was done within Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) - Current
Version 17.5.5

I used C# in the .NET MVC framework. The database used SQL.

# Useful Websites


- [ASP.NET documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-7.0)
- [Tutorial: add sorting and filtering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/sort-filter-page?view=aspnetcore-7.0)

# Future Work

- Using CSS, make the site more visually appealing (low priority)
- Add better validation for data entry
- Give the user more options with which to query the database.
